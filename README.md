# McGrathNicol VirtualInternship Task2

## Here is the background information on your task

The vast majority of security breaches take place when attackers gain access to an environment by stealing a user’s identity. Discovering compromised identities can be tricky and often involve sifting through large quantities of data looking for suspicious activity (i.e. external IP addresses logging into accounts and altering rules that differ from the known IPs).

The client’s IT & Security personnel have provided their Office 365 audit logs, which covers the period 1 June 2018 – 30 June 2018 (this particular breach occurred between 25 - 29 June 2018). These logs will be critical in this investigation, as from these we will be able to determine unauthorised access from external IP addresses. 

The following IP information should be noted:

There is one IP resolving to the UK, as there is one staff member on a work trip in London. This should be considered a known IP;
The three WAN IPs that all resolve in Sydney should be considered known IPs; and
Any other IPs found within the logs should be considered unknown IPs and potential threats.
